Programming languages C, C++, JAVA

Operating system - Windows, Unix(Solaris, Linux, Ubuntu)

1) Introduction to JAVA
    C - Procedure Oriented language - Platform dependent
	C++ - Object Oriented language - Platform dependent
	Java - Pure Object Oriented language - Platform independent
	
2) Compilation and Platform Independent
    JDK - Java development Kit
	JRE - Java Runtime environment
	
	Class --> methods (main - default)
	
	Java program --> save --> HelloWorld.java
	
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-1.8  bin (javac, java)
	
	Command Prompt
	C:\Users\HP>java -version
    java version "1.8.0_381"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_381-b09)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.381-b09, mixed mode)
	
	JDK: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-1.8\bin (compilation and Execution)
	JRE: C:\Program Files\Java\jre-1.8\bin (Only Execution)
	
	2 steps:
	Compilation - javac(java compiler) --> D:\Java>javac HelloWorld.java --> ouput (HelloWorld.class)
	Execution   - java --> HelloWorld.class --> D:\Java>java HelloWorld --> 
	
	HelloWorld.class --> ByteCode --> runs in any environment --> platform independent
	
	Java 8
	Java 11

3) OOPS(Object Oriented Programming) Concepts
     Class
	 Objects --> Instances of Class
	 Data Abstraction --> Abstraction is a process which displays only the information needed and hides the unnecessary information. 
	                 We can say that the  main purpose of abstraction is data hiding
					    Interface or abstract class
	 Encapsulation --> it is the process that binds together the data and code into a single unit and keeps both from being safe from 
	                   outside interference and misuse. 
	                   In this process, the data is hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the current class’s methods
	 Inheritance --> Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires/inherits another object’s properties, and inheritance also 
	                 supports hierarchical classification
	 Polymorphism --> Polymorphism refers to many forms, or it is a process that performs a single action in different ways
