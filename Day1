     Class
	 Objects --> Instances of Class
	 Data Abstraction --> Abstraction is a process which displays only the information needed and hides the unnecessary information. 
	                 We can say that the  main purpose of abstraction is data hiding
					    Interface or abstract class
	 Encapsulation --> it is the process that binds together the data and code into a single unit and keeps both from being safe from 
	                   outside interference and misuse. 
	                   In this process, the data is hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the current class’s methods
	 Inheritance --> Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires/inherits another object’s properties, and inheritance also 
	                 supports hierarchical classification
	 Polymorphism --> Polymorphism refers to many forms, or it is a process that performs a single action in different ways
