Data Abstraction


Defination: 
- Abstraction is a process which displays only the information needed and hides the unnecessary information. 
- Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.
- We can say that the  main purpose of abstraction is data hiding.

Real-Life Example:
-----------------
Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of a car or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
