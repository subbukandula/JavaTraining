Encapsulation

Defination:
- It is the process that binds together the data and code into a single unit and keeps both from being safe from outside interference and misuse. 
- In this process, the data is hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the current classâ€™s methods
					   
Example:
-------				   
public class Car{
	
	private String carName;  //variables
	private String carModel;
	
	public void setCarName(String carName){   //method
	    this.carName = carName;
	}
	
	public void setCarModel(String carModel){
	    this.carModel = carModel;
	}
	
	public static void main(Sting args[]){ // main method
	   
	   Car car = new Car();   //object creation --> using new keyword
	   
	   car.setCarName("Creta");
	   car.setCarModel("Huyndai")
	
	}
	
}
